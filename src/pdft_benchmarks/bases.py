"""Basis registry: name -> factory(m, n, seed) -> AbstractSparseBasis.

Adding a new basis variant = one entry here.

Note: m+n is the total qubit count. MERA requires m+n to be a power of 2;
the pipeline checks this and emits a "skipped: incompatible_qubits" record
rather than raising.

For BlockedBasis variants, the convention here is that the inner basis
operates on a (m_inner, n_inner) sub-block where (m, n) refers to the
OUTER image dimensions and the block size is (2 ** block_log_m,
2 ** block_log_n). The default partition is (m // 2, n // 2) for both
the inner basis and block_log values, which yields square blocks of size
sqrt(image_size). Customize by importing the factories directly and
constructing BlockedBasis with explicit block_log_m / block_log_n.
